# Dungeons and the Underdark

In keeping with the general weirdness and paucity of the rest of my video gaming experience in the 1990's...

When people talk about dungeon crawlers, I don't so much think of _Eye of the Beholder_ or _Diablo_ or _Ultima Underworld_ or _The Bard's Tale_.  Rather, it's _Wizardry VI: Bane of the Cosmic Forge_.

And only that one, because I've never actually played any of the other _Wizardry_ games.

_Bane of the Cosmic Forge_, like _Zork_ and _The Goonies II_, fits into the large category of games that I never managed to beat without a walkthrough.  It's another ridiculously difficult game.

It's like _Zork_ in that it assumes that you are carefully mapping every move you make.  It's also like _Zork_ in that it will cheerfully allow you to render the game unwinnable.  Unlike _Zork_, it doesn't have the mechanism of the lantern's batteries limiting the amount of time you're actually able to play the game.  In my case, I played the game for, I think, a few years without realizing I'd managed to jam a door that was critical for further progression.  Every once in a while I'd start playing the game, mosey around the dungeon a bit, and not make any progress, and of course blame myself for my stupidity.

Sir-Tech also had a phone line you could call in for hints.  I don't recall them doing me much good.

But this isn't really about my grievances with ridiculously difficult relics, but what I actually find enjoyable and compelling about these games.

_Sidenote: I recently played through the three **Zork** games with my kid.  I still needed walkthroughs.  And he was, like me, baffled by the puzzles and mazes and frustrated that they even made it into the game.  I explained that the thinking at the time was that you were going to be mapping the game with pen and paper as you played it, but I'd never realized that when I played them.  All the same, that doesn't seem a terribly satisfying rationalization to me, 25-30 years later._

No, I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the structure of the dungeon, and exploring it.  It's true that every bit of the dungeon looked like every other bit of the dungeon.  And in fact the belfrey and the mines and the River Styx and the pyramid and even the damned forest looked like every other bit of the dungeon, which is... kind of amazing now.  How hard would it have been to make a second tileset?

But I digress.

In some areas, particularly around the castle towers, there were lovely bits of text as you explored.

Even in the graphical CRPGs of the time, they frequently had to add text to fill in the details of what the characters were experiencing.  And it's those bits of text that really made the dungeon interesting.
