# Introduction

This project is a kind of single-player MUD, or maybe "open world" "interactive fiction".  I don't know if the idea makes any sense at all.  I've had some great experiences playing MUDs, roguelikes, and interactive fiction over the years, and this is an attempt to capture and expand on some of that.  Perhaps in a form that I might work on for the rest of my life, my own personal _Dwarf Fortress_.

In this "book," I'm going to try to formally structure my ideas a bit in a more narrative form than GitHub Projects, issues, epics, etc allow.  I expect this project to take quite a while, assuming I live to complete it, so I figure it's worth getting things down on paper (so to speak).
