# Lasthearth

Lasthearth is an experimental programming language, VM, and domain-specific library.

As part of my work on **Hornvale**, I want to write a scripting language that is:

- powerful
- performant
- tailored to the subject at hand, which is creating highly extensible virtual worlds

I can afford to compromise the first and second points for the third, given the nature of Hornvale.

This work is based on Lox, from Robert Nystrom's amazing [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com), and specifically his bytecode-based CLox, but I'm customizing it heavily based on my personal preferences and intended use case, and adding bindings for functionality in other projects.
