# FAQ

#### Why are you generating stellar neighborhoods for an interactive fiction project?
Because I'm an idiot, most likely.

#### Is this singleplayer or multiplayer?
Singleplayer.  A lot of this is informed by MUDs, but their nature (being multiplayer and easy to join) forces some design decisions on MUDs that I don't think I want to follow.  For instance, I want to largely avoid grinding.  Incredible levels of grinding can be required in MUDs because of Massively Online players, and I don't think that farming XP or skills is the experience I want to create.

#### Are you really calling this _Hornvale_?  What does that even mean?
I use castle names from George R. R. Martin's _A Song of Ice and Fire_ for project names.  Gives me something interesting and at least semi-evocative, but also narrows my choices so I don't spend all damned day bikeshedding the project name.

So "Hornvale" might be a codename, it might be the name of the game for all eternity, I might rename this at some point to _Seymour Butts in the Festival of Massacres II: Revenge of the Soulslurpers_.  No idea.  I just don't care.  I already spend too much time naming things.
