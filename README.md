# Hornvale
Hornvale[ðŸ“–](https://ndouglas.github.io/hornvale/)  is an experimental, idiosyncratic game written in Rust.  I was referring to it as a "prose-based roguelike", but now I'm thinking it might be more like "open-world interactive fiction".  

I don't know if this is stupid or not.  It's a more personal project than I typically throw on GitHub, and I'm making it up as I go.

For more (a lot more) on my approach to the project, check out the [Book](https://ndouglas.github.io/hornvale/), which is pretty much what's going to document my goals, inspirations, etc.  For a more technical overview of the code, check out [ARCHITECTURE](./ARCHITECTURE.md), or the [FAQ](./FAQ.md) for questions I've anticipated.

## Major Ideas
The main thing I want to play with, that ties this to the roguelike tradition, is procedural content generation.  But I'm also deeply embedded in interactive (and non-interactive) fiction, and MUDs, both of which tend to be intentionally authored experiences.  The former is deeply invested in a notion of efficient storytelling, the latter in a more open-world concept with multiple narratives.  I'd like to explore this area and figure out what sort of messes I can cause.

This is likely to be an incredible amount of work, and frankly, I don't really have a good history with regard to actually completing personal projects, so feel free to just cruise right by this one.  Also, the fact that I've Unlicensed this is probably a good indicator of how much general appeal this project has.

But maybe this will be something that grows over time into something worth looking at.

## Prior Incarnation
A previous iteration, purely exploratory, can be found [here](https://github.com/ndouglas/hornvale-rust/).  It was/is mostly just investigatory, figuring out what was possible, and whether I could bear to do it in Rust.
