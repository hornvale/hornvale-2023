# Hornvale
Hornvale[📖](https://ndouglas.github.io/hornvale/)  is an experimental, idiosyncratic game written in Rust.  I was referring to it as a "prose-based roguelike", but now I'm thinking it might be more like "open-world interactive fiction".  

I don't know if this is stupid or not.  It's a more personal project than I typically throw on GitHub, and I'm making it up as I go.

For more (a lot more) on my approach to the project, check out the [book](https://ndouglas.github.io/hornvale/), which is pretty much what's going to serve as documentation.

## Major Ideas
The main thing I want to play with, that ties this to the roguelike tradition, is procedural content generation.  But I'm also deeply embedded in interactive (and non-interactive) fiction, and MUDs, both of which tend to be intentionally authored experiences.  The former is deeply invested in a notion of efficient storytelling, the latter in a more open-world concept with multiple narratives.  I'd like to explore this area and figure out what sort of messes I can cause.

This is likely to be an incredible amount of work, and frankly, I don't really have a good history with regard to actually completing personal projects, so feel free to just cruise right by this one.  Also, the fact that I've Unlicensed this is probably a good indicator of how much general appeal this project has.

But maybe this will be something that grows over time into something worth looking at.

## Prior Incarnation
A previous iteration, purely exploratory, can be found [here](https://github.com/ndouglas/hornvale-rust/).  It was/is mostly just investigatory, figuring out what was possible, and whether I could bear to do it in Rust.

## Hornvale Subprojects
I know these names are somewhat opaque, but my thinking is that I decouple the name from a concrete name like "astronomy" and gain some flexibility with the borders.

## FAQ

#### Why are you generating stellar neighborhoods for an interactive fiction project?
Because I'm an idiot, most likely.

#### Is this singleplayer or multiplayer?
Singleplayer.  A lot of this is informed by MUDs, but their nature (being multiplayer and easy to join) forces some design decisions on MUDs that I don't think I want to follow.  For instance, I want to largely avoid grinding.  Incredible levels of grinding can be required in MUDs because of Massively Online players, and I don't think that farming XP or skills is the experience I want to create.

#### Are you really calling this _Hornvale_?  What does that even mean?
I use castle names from George R. R. Martin's _A Song of Ice and Fire_ for project names.  Gives me something interesting and at least semi-evocative, but also narrows my choices so I don't spend all damned day bikeshedding the project name.

So "Hornvale" might be a codename, it might be the name of the game for all eternity, I might rename this at some point to _Seymour Butts in the Festival of Massacres II: Revenge of the Soulslurpers_.  No idea.  I just don't care.  I already spend too much time naming things.

#### Do you have any code coverage eyecandy?
Uh, yeah, sure.  Oddly specific.
