# Hornvale
Hornvale is an experimental, idiosyncratic game written in Rust.  I was referring to it as a "prose-based roguelike", but now I'm thinking it might be more like "open world interactive fiction".  

I don't know if this is stupid or not.  It's a more personal project than I typically throw on GitHub, and I'm making it up as I go.

## Prior Incarnation
A previous iteration, purely exploratory, can be found [here](https://github.com/ndouglas/hornvale-rust/).  It was/is mostly just investigatory, figuring out what was possible, and whether I could bear to do it in Rust.
