Artificial life, social/factional/economic simulation and procedural content generation and tools.

The general hope here is that I can generate something like a goblin village and its environs (probably leaning on [Starfall](../starfall/README.md) for the latter part), run it for forty years, and provide the player with the resulting situation.

So we might use [Starfall](../starfall/README.md) to create a planetary system with a binary sun and three moons and no axial tilt and see what sort of foliage and geology and geography we have to work with.  

That can inform the sort of mythopoesis we are likely to deal with; the sorts of narratives, cultural obsessions, etc, as constructed in [Goldengrove](../goldengrove/README.md).  **Appleton** and **Goldengrove** can thus work together; we have a concept of goblins, and we have concepts of other lifeforms that we throw into the mix (let's say that orcs are a no-go, but ogres and hobgoblins are major players), and then we can see how goblin society might evolve on this planet.  

Linguistics is a part of this.  I would like to be able to generate believable languages for different races, including a tree-like branching structure; hobgoblin and goblin might be very closely related indeed, with ogrish being a cousin, and trollish utterly foreign.

I would like to develop economic systems too.  Perhaps goblins are enslaved by hobgoblins, and hobgoblins exist in an uneasy trading relationship with orcs.  This would mean that goblins might be very amenable to trade with a well-equipped human, seeing immediately how even a low-level magical item could immensely boost their social standing.

Factions, also, should be a consideration.  I would like this system to be intricate and multifaceted.  For instance, a goblin would have some loyalty to their species and a different amount to their tribe, a different amount to the goblinoid family (in the taxonomic sense), a different amount to The Forces of Darkness or whatever.
