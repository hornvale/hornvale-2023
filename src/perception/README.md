# Perception

**Perception** is an event system.  It deals with processing of [Sensation](../sensation/README.md).  This is not one-to-one, for instance a goblin may be burned while it is unconscious and therefore not perceive it.  Or a goblin might eat a hallucinogenic mushroom and perceive sensations that aren't there.  Sensations are objective, perceptions are subjective.
