# Entity

**Entity** is intended to be about the most generic class of things we can imagine.  Monsters are entities.  Battery-powered brass lanterns are entities.  The player is an entity.  Rooms are... not entities, but behave like them in some contexts.

The intent of this is to be able to treat things alike in accordance with their characteristics and capabilities.  Composite pattern.  That sort of thing.
