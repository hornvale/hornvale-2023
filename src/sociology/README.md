Social psychology and sociology, individual and group behavior.

Take the biological and psychological technology in [Appleton](../../appleton/README.md) and layer on sociology and economics, incorporate the magic energy from [Ramsgate](../../ramsgate/README.md) to form guilds: traders, thieves, wizards, farmers, merchants.  Create families, biological imperatives, honor systems, and create motives and goals that span generations.  

This is obviously going to be very complex.  We need to handle a lot of emotions, perceptions, expectations, things like that, have something like events that are based on that.  

Imagine sitting in a tavern, nursing an ale.  A man comes in -- a courier -- and sidles up to the bar.  He informs the tavernkeeper that a mutual acquaintance (call him "Steve") has made a bet that he will seduce the tavernkeeper's young daughter.  The tavernkeeper explodes in anger, takes a weapon from under the bar, and exits to find "Steve".

That's expressible, I think.  It's the breadth of what needs to be implemented, not the depth, that make this a challenge.
